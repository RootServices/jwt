### {{ page.title }} ###

A [JSON Web Token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519){:target="_blank"} (JWT) is a strategy to transfer a message between two systems,
a sender and a recipient. The sender may sign the message which the recipient should verify. This may give the recipient 
 confidence that the message originated from the expected sender.
 
 The features that are implemented are listed on the [releases post]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/project/releases).
